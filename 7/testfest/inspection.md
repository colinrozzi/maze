## TEST FEST

No deductions; `xbad` does not directly use the input spec to form the cheaters output.

## GIT LOG INSPECTION

[70/70]

- [10/10] for git add remote as instructed by the "new repo" instructions of GH Enterprise
- [30/30] checking that a large non-trivial commit is not copied code from other repo
- [30/30] same as above with a different commit

## TECH DEBT DOWNPAYMENT -- everyone

[80/80]

- [20/20] for an accurate and helpful self evaluation.
- [10/10] descriptive tasks in todo.md (e.g. not "Improve the code").
- [50/50] the git commit message for five completed bullets help the reader understand the change and appreciate the improvement to the code.

## REQUIRED REVISION

[32/40]

The require revision calls for
- the relaxation of the constraints on the board size
- a suitability check for the board size vs player number

- [10/10] a unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not 7 x 7)
- [10/10] a unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not square)
- [6/10] a unit test that validates that a board is suitabile for the given number of players
  - Does not exist but said so on self-eval.
- [6/10] a unit that that rejects a board as too small for the given number of players
  - Does not exist but said so on self-eval.

## DESIGN

[15/15]

- [5/5] for ranking all three tasks with one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- [5/5] for using complete sentences for each explanation
- [5/5] for delivering acceptable explanations
