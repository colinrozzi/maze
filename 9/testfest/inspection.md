- [10/10] find the player(s) that has(have) visited the highest number of goals, Auxillary function  with a good name or a purpose statement

- [6/10] compute their distances to the home tile, Auxillary function  with a good name or a purpose statement
  -- points for honesty

- [6/10] pick those with the shortest distance as winners, Auxillary function  with a good name or a purpose statement
