SUBJECT: Questions About the Maze Game Problem Statement   


1. For each canonical shape, how many tiles with that shape are included in the set of tiles used to set up the initial board?

2. What precisely is the procedure for arranging tiles, gems, and player homes during initial board setup?

3. Part 3 of section **Playing a Turn** states that after the player shifts a row or column and places a tile their avatar *may not* remain on the tile where it is located, but what if there are no connections between the tile with the avatar and its adjacent tiles (meaning the player can't move)?
