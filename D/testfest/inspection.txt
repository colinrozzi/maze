  - The problem statement states three tasks:
    	- read all pieces of an arbitrarily long series of JSON values
    	- turn the complete series of JSON values into a drawing and display it
    	- "catch" and print the coordinate of the first mouse click
  - All points if they factor out _two_ of these tasks into separate functions.
